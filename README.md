# Assetto Corsa Tire Temperature App
This is an application that can be used to help visualize and see the data of each tires temperatures for your car in Assetto Corsa. A second application I have done for this game through the usage of studying other source code.

Technologies:
- Python
- AC
- ACSYS

As the name suggests, this app displays your core tire temps, the inner, the outter, and the middle, temperatures of the tires for your car. Which can be useful if you want to know how hot or cold or if the temperature is ideal for the tires themselves. It also, displays the temperature of the tires themselves in colors such as green is ideal, red is hot, and blue is cold or getting colder. 

Features:
- Displays the core tire temps.
- Displays the inner, outter, and middle tire temps.
- Graphically displays the tires
- Color code for the tire temps. 
- Calculates the tire temps to display the right colors on the tires.

Please do note that the application does work vanilla cars and some other modded cars meaning that if the tire itself is not from the vanilla game, the color feature won't work I have tried finding ways to make it work but was unsucessful. 

Video Demo: (working on that)

Running the app:
- Install the app.
- Extract the file.
- Open up the Assetto-Corsa-Tire-Temperature-App-main folder.
- Find the folder.
- Find your AC directory.
- Find the apps folders.
- Put the Tire Temp folder into the python folder.
Another way:
- Install the app.
- Extract the file (if you want to).
- Open up the Assetto-Corsa-Tire-Temperature-App-main folder.
- Find the Tire Temp folder.
- Drag and drop the file into Content Manager (make sure that it is opened).
- Install in there.
- Go to the contents tab.
- Go to apps.
- Make sure Tire Temp is activated.

I guess if you did the first way and have CM you don't have to install it in CM you can just activate it. 

Pretty cool stuff I suppose. Gonna do some more with AC.
